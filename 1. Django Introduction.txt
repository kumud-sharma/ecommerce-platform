I. Introduction :
-----------------
    - Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
    - Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, 
      so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. 
    - Itâ€™s free and open source.

II. Key Features :
------------------

    1.ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
    ---------------------------------

        - Django comes with a powerful ORM that allows developers to interact with the database 
          using Python code instead of writing SQL queries. 
        - This makes database operations more intuitive and less error-prone.

    2. Admin Interface
    ------------------
        - Django automatically generates an admin interface for your project, 
          allowing you to manage your application's data easily. 
        - This is highly customizable and can be used to create a powerful backend system.

    3. Authentication
    -----------------
        - Django includes a robust authentication system that handles user authentication and authorization. 
        - It provides tools for managing users, groups, permissions, and more.

    4. Scalability
    --------------
        - Django is designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible. 
        - It can handle high traffic and large datasets, making it suitable for scalable web applications.

    5. Security
    -----------
        - Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid common security mistakes. 
        - It includes features such as protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting, 
          cross-site request forgery, and clickjacking.

    6. Versatile
    ------------
        - Django is suitable for any type of project, from content management systems and e-commerce sites 
          to social networks and scientific computing platforms.

    7. Template Engine
    ------------------
        - Django's template engine allows you to separate design from business logic. 
        - It enables you to create dynamic HTML content by combining data with HTML templates.

    8. URL Routing
    --------------
        - Django's URL routing mechanism maps URLs to views, making it easy to design a 
          clean URL structure for your application.

    9. Internationalization
    -----------------------
        - Django has built-in support for multilingual websites, allowing you to easily translate 
          your application into different languages.

III. Django MVT Architecture
----------------------------

    - Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern. 
    - This is similar to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, with a slight difference in 
      the terminology and handling of the controller logic.

    Model
    -----
        - The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. 
        - It defines the structure of the database and is a single, definitive source of information about your data. 
        - Each model maps to a single database table.

    View
    ----
        - The view is responsible for executing the business logic and interacting with the model. 
        - It processes user input, retrieves data from the model, and passes it to the template for rendering.

    Template
    --------
        - The template is responsible for rendering the data provided by the view in a presentable format. 
        - It defines how the data should be displayed to the user.
